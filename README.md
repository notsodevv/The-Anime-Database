# Build an ANIME Search Database in React JS with Jikan Anime API

In this project, we will learn how to build an anime search database using the Jikan Anime API and React JS but more specifically, react hooks. We look into forms, fetching data, components and looping through arrays to display cards. We also utilize SCSS as our preprocessor.

## Create React App

Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React.

It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them.

When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide.
